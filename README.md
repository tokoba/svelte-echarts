This project is for my learning ECharts library and Svelte 5 Runes.

Thanks to @bherbruck, we can use ECharts in svelte components.

```bash

## disclaimer

I love Svelte however I am kind of newbie in front-end devlopment, I tried to read Svelte official docs and EChart official docs, however there could be some bugs.
If you think this code useful as reference, please contact @bherbruck - the original project owner.
